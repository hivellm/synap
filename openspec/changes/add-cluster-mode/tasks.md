# Tasks: Add Cluster Mode

> **Status**: ðŸ“‹ Deferred  
> **Target**: v0.8.0-alpha  
> **Priority**: Medium (Phase 4)  
> **Note**: High complexity, requires 2-3 engineers, deferred due to resource constraints

## Core (15+ commands, ~300 tasks, 12 weeks)

### Implementation
- [ ] Hash slot algorithm (CRC16 mod 16384)
- [ ] Cluster topology management
- [ ] Slot migration with zero downtime
- [ ] Raft consensus for coordination
- [ ] Automatic failover
- [ ] 40+ unit tests

### Testing
- [ ] 50+ unit tests, 30+ integration tests, cluster simulation tests

**NOTE**: Deferred due to very high complexity. Requires 2-3 engineers.
